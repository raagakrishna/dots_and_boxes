            <h2>What is Dots and Boxes?</h2>
            <p>Dots and Boxes is a simple pencil-and-paper game for two to six players. This game requires no software to be installed; you just need to create an account, and start playing with friends adn family.</p>

            <p>This game starts with an empty grid of dots; the creator of the game can specify how large the grid can be. A player plays by selecting a line (horizontal or vertical line that joins to dots). A player scores a point once a box is completed, and earns another turn. </p>

            <p>The game ends when there are no more lines left to play. The winner of the game is the player with most points. </p>


            <h2>How do I play?</h2>
